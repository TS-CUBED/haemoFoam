# haemoFoam

Haemodynamics simulation framework based on OpenFOAM. Includes particle migration model and advanced haemorheology models, as well as windkessel boundary conditions.

The current development is on OpenFOAM v2206.

## If you want to use haemoFoam

HaemoFoam is published under the GPL (as is OpenFoam). You are, therefore, free to use it. I would ask you for three things, though:

1. Please reference my work if you use haemoFoam in your research and publications.
2. Please contribute back to haemoFoam and don't just fork it. I would hope we can develop this together in a mutually useful direction.
3. Please get in touch and let me know what you want to do. I an happy to collaborate.

## Installation

Initialise OpenFOAM (e.g. `. /usr/lib/openfoam/openfoam2306/etc/bashrc`) and then run

`./Allwmake`

from the main `haemoFoam-0.n.n` directory. This will install all the solvers and models.
