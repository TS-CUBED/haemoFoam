# haemoFoam

Haemodynamics simulation framework based on OpenFOAM. Includes particle migration model and advanced haemorheology models, as well as windkessel boundary conditions.

The current development is on OpenFOAM v2112, but the haemodynamics/haemorheology model will work on foam-extend, the Windkessel model is only implemented in OF (ESI).

## Installation

Initialise OpenFOAM (e.g. `. /usr/lib/openfoam/openfoam2106/etc/bashrc`) and then run

`./Allwmake`

from the main `haemoFoam-0.1` directory. This will install all the solvers and models.
