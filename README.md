# haemoFoam-0.1

Haemodynamics simulation framework based on OpenFOAM. Includes particle migration model and advanced haemorheology models, as well as windkessel boundary conditions.

The current development is on OpenFOAM v2106, but the haemodynamics/haemorheology model will work on foam-extend, the Windkessel model is only implemented in OF (ESI).
